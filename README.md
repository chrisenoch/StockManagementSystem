# StockManagmentSystem - Shoes
A project to practise the Template pattern the Java 8 Streams API, SQL queries and building databases.

Different shoe shops may have different rules when ordering their stock. For instance, ShopA may only be able to hold X number of stock and Y types of a certain product. On the other hand, ShopB may be a Men's outlet and may not permit women's items. This app accounts for all of these possibilities.
