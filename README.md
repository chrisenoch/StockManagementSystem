# StockManagmentSystem
A project to practise the Template pattern and the Java 8 Streams API

Different shops may have different rules when ordering their stock. For instance, ShopA may only be able to hold X number of stock and Y types of a certain product. On the other hand, ShopB may be a Men's outlet and may permit women's items to be ordered and may not sell a certain type of shoe. This app accounts for all of these possibilities.
